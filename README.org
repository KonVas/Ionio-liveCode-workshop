*** Live Coding in SuperCollider
Creating sound with SuperCollider can be very rewarding using its
ready made unit generators to build novel instruments and sound
generators, but what happens when one wants to improvise the structure
of these instruments and change them on the fly.

** Live coding as a musical performance paradigm
Dynamic or interactive programming, commonly known as live
coding (in electronic music, and digital arts) is a performance
paradigm that allows the performer(s) to create an instrument instead
of interacting with it by altering its control inputs or parameters.  For
this we will use JITLib shipped in SuperCollider optimised for just in
time programming techniques, which allows the user to interact and
interfere without having to stop and update the synthesis processes
while at run. This allows the performer to improvise and change the
state of the sound manipulation dynamically, expanding the interaction
affordances of the software in real time. Examples made in
SuperCollider, can be found at this repository. For more information
about live coding as performance paradigm see this [[http://toplap.org][page]].
